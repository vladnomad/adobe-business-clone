# Clone of the Adobe Business home page

Project is aimed at showcasing and improving my HTML and CSS writing from scratch by recreating a single page in its entirity. 
Tailwind CSS was chosen as the only option for styling to challenge myself and get to know this amazing framework with greater detail. 
I chose a Mobile First Approach, developing for handheld devices and upscaling to desktop in order to leave HTML and CSS as lightweight as possible.
